The <code>AccessibilityRenderExtension</code> does not inform developers whether or not the accessibility properties and their content are appropriate for the specific use case of your UI.

The colors for each item in the legend match each accessibility element with its corresponding UI element. Each highlighted area is a single screen reader focusable element.</p> <p>To help understand whether the accessibility property values you are seeing in your snapshots are sufficient for providing your customers with an accessible experience, referencing the WCAG criteria is a good place to start. For example, 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value is a criteria that must be met for any custom component you create (standard Android components will meet this criteria by default). To pass that criteria, the name (e.g. \u201cSubmit\u201d), role (e.g. \u201cButton\u201d) and value (if applicable, e.g. \u201cSelected\u201d), must be available to assistive technology users.
