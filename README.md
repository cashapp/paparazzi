Paparazzi
========

An Android library to render your application screens without a physical device or emulator.

```kotlin
class LaunchViewTest {
  @get:Rule
  val paparazzi = Paparazzi(
    deviceConfig = PIXEL_5,
    theme = "android:Theme.Material.Light.NoActionBar"
    // ...see docs for more options
  )

  @Test
  fun launchView() {
    val view = paparazzi.inflate<LaunchView>(R.layout.launch)
    // or...
    // val view = LaunchView(paparazzi.context)

    view.setModel(LaunchModel(title = "paparazzi"))
    paparazzi.snapshot(view)
  }

  @Test
  fun launchComposable() {
    paparazzi.snapshot {
      MyComposable()
    }
  }
}
```

See the [project website][paparazzi] for documentation and APIs.

Tasks
-------

```bash
./gradlew sample:testDebug
```

Runs tests and generates an HTML report at `sample/build/reports/paparazzi/` showing all
test runs and snapshots.

```bash
./gradlew sample:recordPaparazziDebug
```

Saves snapshots as golden values to a predefined source-controlled location
(defaults to `src/test/snapshots`).

```bash
./gradlew sample:verifyPaparazziDebug
```

Runs tests and verifies against previously-recorded golden values. Failures generate diffs at `sample/build/paparazzi/failures`.

For more examples, check out the [sample][sample] project.

Git LFS
--------
It is recommended you use [Git LFS][lfs] to store your snapshots.  Here's a quick setup:

```bash
brew install git-lfs
git config core.hooksPath  # optional, confirm where your git hooks will be installed
git lfs install --local
git lfs track "**/snapshots/**/*.png"
git add .gitattributes
```

On CI, you might set up something like:

`$HOOKS_DIR/pre-receive`
```bash
# compares files that match .gitattributes filter to those actually tracked by git-lfs
diff <(git ls-files ':(attr:filter=lfs)' | sort) <(git lfs ls-files -n | sort) >/dev/null

ret=$?
if [[ $ret -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo >&2 "This remote has detected files committed without using Git LFS. Run 'brew install git-lfs && git lfs install' to install it and re-commit your files.";
  exit 1;
fi
```

`your_build_script.sh`
```bash
if [[ is running snapshot tests ]]; then
  # fail fast if files not checked in using git lfs
  "$HOOKS_DIR"/pre-receive
  git lfs install --local
  git lfs pull
fi
```

Jetifier
--------

If using Jetifier to migrate off Support libraries, add the following to your `gradle.properties` to
exclude bundled Android dependencies.

```properties
android.jetifier.ignorelist=android-base-common,common
```

Lottie
--------

When taking screenshots of Lottie animations, you need to force Lottie to not run on a background thread, otherwise Paparazzi can throw exceptions [#494](https://github.com/cashapp/paparazzi/issues/494), [#630](https://github.com/cashapp/paparazzi/issues/630).

```kotlin
@Before
fun setup() {
    LottieTask.EXECUTOR = Executor(Runnable::run)
}
```

LocalInspectionMode
--------
Some Composables -- such as `GoogleMap()` -- check for `LocalInspectionMode` to short-circuit to a `@Preview`-safe Composable.

However, Paparazzi does not set `LocalInspectionMode` globally to ensure that the snapshot represents the true production output, similar to how it overrides `View.isInEditMode` for legacy views.

As a workaround, we recommend wrapping such a Composable in a custom Composable with a `CompositionLocalProvider` and setting `LocalInspectionMode` there.

```kotlin
 @Test
  fun inspectionModeView() {
    paparazzi.snapshot(
      CompositionLocalProvider(LocalInspectionMode provides true) {
        YourComposable()
      }
    )
  }
```

Releases
--------

Our [change log][changelog] has release history.

Using plugin application:
```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    google()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'app.cash.paparazzi:paparazzi-gradle-plugin:1.3.4'
