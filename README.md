Paparazzi
========

An Android library to render your application screens without a physical device or emulator.

See the [project website][paparazzi] for documentation and APIs.

Jetifier
--------

If using Jetifier to migrate off Support libraries, add the following to your `gradle.properties` to 
exclude bundled Android dependencies.

```groovy
android.jetifier.ignorelist=android-base-common,common
```

Git LFS
--------
It is recommended you use [Git LFS][lfs] to store your snapshots.  Here's a template to get started.

#### **`.gitattributes`**
```bash
**/snapshots/**/*.png filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

#### **`.hooks/pre-receive`**
```bash
# compares files that match .gitattributes filter to those actually tracked by git-lfs
diff <(git ls-files ':(attr:filter=lfs)' | sort) <(git lfs ls-files -n | sort) >/dev/null

ret=$?
if [[ $ret -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo >&2 "This remote has detected files committed without using Git LFS. Run 'brew install git-lfs && git lfs install' to install it and re-commit your files.";
  exit 1;
fi
```

#### **`.hooks/post-checkout`**
```bash
# Call the git-lfs filter (except in CI)
if [[ not CI ]]; then
  command -v git-lfs >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "This repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path. Run 'brew install git-lfs && git lfs install' to install it."; exit 2; }
  git lfs post-checkout "$@"
fi
```

#### **`.hooks/post-commit`**
```bash
# Call the git-lfs filter (except in CI)
if [[ not CI ]]; then
  command -v git-lfs >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "This repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path. Run 'brew install git-lfs && git lfs install' to install it."; exit 2; }
  git lfs post-commit "$@"
fi
```

#### **`.hooks/post-merge`**
```bash
# Call the git-lfs filter (except in CI)
if [[ not CI ]]; then
  command -v git-lfs >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "This repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path. Run 'brew install git-lfs && git lfs install' to install it."; exit 2; }
  git lfs post-merge "$@"
fi
```

#### **`.hooks/pre-push`**
```bash
# Call the git-lfs filter (except in CI)
if [[ not CI ]]; then
  command -v git-lfs >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "This repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path. Run 'brew install git-lfs && git lfs install' to install it."; exit 2; }
  git lfs pre-push "$@"
fi
```

#### **`your CI script`**
```bash
  if [[ is running snapshot tests ]]; then
    # fail fast if files not checked in using git lfs
    "$REPO_DIR"/.hooks/pre-receive
    git lfs install --local
    git lfs pull
  fi
```

Releases
--------

Our [change log][changelog] has release history.

Using plugin application:
```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    google()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'app.cash.paparazzi:paparazzi-gradle-plugin:0.8.0'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'app.cash.paparazzi'
```

Using the plugins DSL:
```groovy
plugins {
  id 'app.cash.paparazzi' version '0.8.0'
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  maven {
    url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
  }
}
```

Tasks
-------
```
$ ./gradlew some-project:testDebug
```

Runs tests and generates an HTML report at `some-project/build/reports/paparazzi/debug/` showing all 
test runs and snapshots. 

```
$ ./gradlew some-project:recordPaparazziDebug
```

Saves snapshots as golden values to a predefined source-controlled location 
(default: `src/test/snapshots`).

```
$ ./gradlew some-project:verifyPaparazziDebug
```

Runs tests and verifies against previously-recorded golden values.

Check out the [sample][sample].

Known Limitations
-------

#### Resource Resolution Errors
Ex: 
```
java.lang.NullPointerException
  at com.android.ide.common.resources.ResourceResolver.getUnresolvedResource(ResourceResolver.java:421)
```
Paparazzi does not currently support namespaced resources. If you are seeing this error, verify that the following flag is 
not present in the project's `gradle.properties`:
`android.nonTransitiveRClass=true`

-------

#### Running Tests from the IDE
Ex:
```
java.lang.NullPointerException
  at java.base/java.io.File.<init>(File.java:278)
  at app.cash.paparazzi.EnvironmentKt.detectEnvironment(Environment.kt:36)
```
Running tests from the IDE requires Android Studio Arctic Fox or later. 

-------

#### Only runs on JDK 11+
Ex:
```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unsupported JRE detected! Please install and run Paparazzi test suites on JDK 11+.
	at app.cash.paparazzi.EnvironmentKt.checkInstalledJvm(Environment.kt:66)
	at app.cash.paparazzi.EnvironmentKt.detectEnvironment(Environment.kt:37)
```
Running tests with Paparazzi requires JDK 11 or later. 

-------

#### `compileSdkVersion` has to be 29 or higher

> Could not find ... resource matching value 0x... (resolved name: ...) in current configuration.

Ex:
```
Could not find dimen resource matching value 0x10500C0 (resolved name: config_scrollbarSize) in current configuration.
android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: Could not find dimen resource matching value 0x10500C0 (resolved name: config_scrollbarSize) in current configuration.

Could not find integer resource matching value 0x10E00B4 (resolved name: config_screenshotChordKeyTimeout) in current configuration.
android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: Could not find integer resource matching value 0x10E00B4 (resolved name: config_screenshotChordKeyTimeout) in current configuration.
```
To fix these, change the `compileSdkVersion` to 29 or higher.
```kotlin
android {
  compileSdkVersion 29
}
```
