## [1.3.2] - 2024-01-13

### NOTE: Due to a known issue with [how Guava now publishes its artifact](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/6567), you will need to apply the following snippet workaround to your root build.gradle:
```
subprojects {
  plugins.withId("app.cash.paparazzi") {
    // Defer until afterEvaluate so that testImplementation is created by Android plugin.
    afterEvaluate {
      dependencies.constraints {
        add("testImplementation", "com.google.guava:guava") {
          attributes {
            attribute(
              TargetJvmEnvironment.TARGET_JVM_ENVIRONMENT_ATTRIBUTE,
              objects.named(TargetJvmEnvironment, TargetJvmEnvironment.STANDARD_JVM)
            )
          }
          because("LayoutLib and sdk-common depend on Guava's -jre published variant." +
            "See https://github.com/cashapp/paparazzi/issues/906.")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  )

  @Test fun test() {
    paparazzi.snapshot { SomeComposable() }
